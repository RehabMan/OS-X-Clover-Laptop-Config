// Inject plugin-type=1 on _PR.CPU0

// This is experimental to see how only injecting plugin-type with native CPU PM SSDTs
// works on various platforms.
//
// Results: OK on Haswell+, not so good on Ivy
// Notes:
//   iMac17,1 and MacBook9,1 do not have APSS/ACST/APLF/etc
//   others like MacBookPro12,x, MacBook11,x do have it, but it is possible they are not used
//   likely any HWP enabled SMBIOS does not have APSS/ACST/APLF/etc and does not need it
//   could be that any XCPM enabled SMBIOS needs only this plugin-type injection
